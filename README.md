# tec-HTS
TEC-1 measure high-temperature superconductors and test


### try
guess a new High-temperature superconductivity compound



PbO and SrO

why oxides ?

oxides tend to be good electrical insulators, so adding them to a superconducting material could help to increase its electrical resistance and improve its performance.
