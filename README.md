## best new High-temperature superconductivity compound

There is no definitive answer to this question as new high-temperature superconductivity compounds are being discovered and synthesized all the time. Some of the most promising recent compounds include iron-based superconductors such as FeSe and FeTe, as well as cuprate superconductors such as HgBa_2Ca_2Cu_3O_8 and YBa_2Cu_3O_7.


### try
guess a new High-temperature superconductivity compound



PbO and SrO

why oxides ?

oxides tend to be good electrical insulators, so adding them to a superconducting material could help to increase its electrical resistance and improve its performance.
